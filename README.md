# Pina
A Discord bot that allow anyone to pin messages in your server

## Why would I need a bot for that ?
If you want users to pin message, they must have the "Manage Messages" permission.<br/>
However that include the ability to delete messages so it can be a bit risky to give it to everyone.<br/>
Thanks to this bot, anyone is now able to pin message by writing p.pin or by adding ðŸ“Œ emote to the corresponding message.

## Command list
**Pin**: Pin a message<br/>
**Unpin**: Unpin a message<br/>
**Language [language name]**: Set my speaking language<br/>
**Verbosity [none/error/info]**: Set if I say something or not when something occur<br/>
**Whitelist [(optionnal)roles]**: Set the roles that can pin messages, don't write anything for all<br/>
**Prefix [(optionnal)prefix]**: Set the prefix for bot command, don't write anything to allow the use of command without one<br/>
