# Pina
A Discord bot that allow anyone pin messages in your server

## Why would I need a bot for that ?
If you want users to pin message, they must have the "Manage Messages" permission.<br/>
However that include the ability to delete messages so it can be a bit risky to give it to everyone.<br/>
Thanks to this bot, anyone is now able to pin message by writing p.pin or by adding ðŸ“Œ emote to the corresponding message.
